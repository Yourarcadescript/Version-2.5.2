**To install YourArcadeScript 2.5**
1) FTP all the files and folders to your host.

2) You will need a host with a PHP server and MySql database with a user which can create and delete tables (best to create a user with all prividges if unsure).
If you are unfamiliar with how to do this please ask for assistance in the forums.

3) Run the install file YAS25install.php from your browser. The install script will ask for your database details and allow you to enter specifics for your arcade.
The script will attempt to make certain folders writeable. If unsucessful please chmod these folders through your host's cpanel or ftp.

4)Look for the free 500 game pack in the downloads.(These games can be seen on our http://www.keyarcade.com site - amongst others)
Upload all games to the /swf folder and thumbnails to the /img folder. You may also consider purchasing premium gamepacks we offer.

5) The templates have various ad placeholders. You may put your ad code in through the admin panel by editing the code with yours, look for the sizes
in the ad name. Of course you may create your own ads and place them in the script as you wish. From the admin panel note the ad number and 
insert the code like this, assuming ad #3... <?php echo ad('3'); ?>

6)Adding your own logo: The header logo is logo.pngor logo.jpg in the skins/'skin name'/images folder in each skin for each template. The logo is declared in the #top div in style.css.
Logos can be made for free at http://cooltext.com. Another good one is http://flamingtext.com.

7)Look in the Admin panel under manage mochigames for details on setting up the 1 click install of Mochimedia distributed games.

8)Default admin password is... admin. Change immediately.

9)We offer script installation(includes gamepack installs) and low cost game packs. Look at our home page http://www.yourarcadescript.com for details.

If for some reason you encounter any errors during or after installing, please document as many details as possible, perhaps taking a screenshot.
